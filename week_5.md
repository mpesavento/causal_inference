# week 5 quiz

## 1
The intention to treat effect is
the casual effect of treatment assignment on outcome
NOT - the cause effect of treatment received on the outcome

## 2
The potential treatment values of a complier are
A^0=0, A^1=1

## 3
treatment assignment has no impact on treatment received for
always and never takers

## 4
in instrumental verialles analysis, what is meant by a local treatment?
Treatment effect among compliers only

## 5
The monotonicity assumption is necessary for the estimation of
complier average causal effect

## 6
If we do not make the monotonicity assumption, somebody who was observed to have Z=1 and A=0 is:
either a never taker or defier

## 7
If we do make the monotonicity assumption, somebody who was observed to have Z=1 and A=0 is:
definitely a never taker

## 8
The assumption that the instrumental variable Z only affects the outcome through its effect on treatment is called:
the exclusion restriction

## 9
The first stage of two stage least squares is:
regression of treatment received on the instrumental variable

## 10
The strength of an instrumental variable can be measured by:
The association between the instrumental variable and treatment

## 11 a weak instrument will tend to lead to estimates of causal effects that have:
large standard errors

## 12
instrumental variable methods do not require:
ingorability assumption
